It's a bit on the messy side rn, but it has icons.
for lsp support:

1. Install the LSP
2. Configure server like they say here: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md
3. Check with LspInfo cmd

you're gonna need vim-plugged for the plugins so follow instructions here https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

You're gonna need neovim v7+ https://github.com/neovim/neovim
